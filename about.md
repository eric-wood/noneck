NONECK plays narrator/Sherpa in his works. "Breaking the 4th wall", he dissects and critiques his own narrative within these already colorful vignettes. These paintings and painting-inspired installations, delve into the artist's stream of conscious, carrying the viewer into his ether, while pointing out the sites. The kinetic style of colors and object extends to the constant reshuffling of themes and story. Totems are erected, toppled, resurrected, and repeated. The landscapes are the faded texts of past chapters, and the action, foreshadows the next.

NONECK is a Bushwick, NY based artist. His works have been displayed in galleries and collections all over the U.S. and Europe. Resumes upon request.
